## Image Format Guidelines

### File Format Requirement

All images in `images/buildings/` and `images/areas` must be JPEG files.

### Image Size Recommendations

* `images/buildings/*.jpeg` needs to be at least 200x200px
* `images/areas/*.jpeg` needs to be at least 600x400px

### Aspect Ratio Recommendations

* `images/buildings/*.jpeg` needs an aspect ratio of 1:1 (square)
* `images/areas/*.jpeg` needs an aspect ratio of 1.5:1 (width is 1.5 times longer than height)

If an image does not meet the above recommended aspect ratios, they will be scaled and cropped dynamically.

## Generate Image Assets

Run the `generate_images.sh` to convert jpeg images in `images/` folder to webp images.
The script then outputs the webp images to `assets/`

## Generate Selected Material Icons

Icon tree shaking is still not supported in Flutter Web as of Apr 6, 2022. You can track this feature
on [this Flutter GitHub issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/57181).
Without tree shaking, the full `MaterialIcons-Regular.otf` weighs 1.5MB without compression and still
weighs a whopping 515KB after compression by server. Downloading this full otf file slows down initial
page load speed so we need to manually package only those material icons used in this project.
We rely on fluttericon.com to generate the custom icon font for us. To add or change the list
of icons packaged:

1. Go to fluttericon.com
2. Drag and drop the `fluttericon_config.json` to the website
3. Search for new icons to include or drag and drop custom SVGs to the website.
4. Download a zip from the website
5. Replace the `fonts/MaterialIconsSelected.ttf` and `lib/MaterialIconsSelected.dart` with the new files in the zip folder
6. Replace the old `fluttericon_config.json` with the new one in the downloaded zip

### Note

1. fluttericon.com only accepts `<path>` in SVG, so newer versions of material icons may need manual
   conversion to work on fluttericon.com.
2. Reference this guide for more details: https://medium.com/codechai/how-to-use-custom-icons-in-flutter-834a079d977

## Generate App Name

Run `./generate_app_name.sh` to generate new app names for Android, iOS, and Web.

## Generate App and Web Icons Locally

1. Install PNG compression tool pngquant
   `brew install pngquant`

2. Install ImageMagick tool
   `brew install imagemagick`

3. Put the new icons (must be 512x512) in as `assets/icon_512.png` and `assets/icon_maskable_512.png`

4. See this tutorial on [maskable icons](https://web.dev/maskable_icon/). You should also test your
   maskable icons using [this online tool](https://maskable.app/).

5. Run `generate_icons.sh`. You can only run this script *once* on the new icons!
   Running multiple times may *increase* the size of the icons because of repeated redundant compression.
